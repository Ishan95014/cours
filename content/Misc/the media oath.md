>From this moment on, we will be deciding what goes on our air and how it is presented to you based on the simple truth that nothing is more important to a democracy than a well-informed electorate.

>We’ll endeavor to put information in a broader context because we know that very little news is born at the moment it comes across our wire.

>We’ll be the champion of facts and the mortal enemy of innuendo, speculation, hyperbole, and nonsense.

>We’re not waiters in a restaurant serving you the stories you asked for, just the way you like them prepared, nor are we computers dispensing only the facts because the news is only useful in the context of humanity.

>I’ll make no effort to subdue my personal opinions, I will make every effort to expose you to informed opinions that are different from my own. 

Will McAvoy, [[Aaron Sorkin]], [[The Newsroom]], S1E03 *The Media Elite*
